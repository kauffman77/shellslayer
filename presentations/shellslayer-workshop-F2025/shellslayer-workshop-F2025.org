#+TITLE: ACM ShellSlayer Fall 2025 Workshop
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: beamer
#+INCLUDE: ~/Dropbox/misc/header_minted.org

* Preamble

Visit: https://go.umd.edu/shellslayer
- Includes link to github page for ShellSlayer
- Includes a link to the *Cheat Sheet* in case you are stuck
- Has a Feedback Form to fill in at the end of this session

If you wore a costume *come get some candy.*  If there is any left,
others can partake

* Welcome Slayers
** Immediate Goals
- Illustrate Docker as a way to get a shell environment / run programs
- Learn a some useful Unix commands and shell tricks that may improve
  your life on the command line
- Have some fun and eat some candy

** Long Term Goals
- Consider contributing to the tutorial via playtesting, writing
  levels, etc.
- Add some levels on some topics not covered

** Thank yous
- ACM leaders who invited me to join you (Zephyriah)
- Past ACM playtesters and facilitators

*"Install Docker"* and follow the instructions

#+LATEX:\vspace{-.2in}
- Docker is a system by which "containers" can be set up to run
  programs
- Containers provide a skeleton operating system along with
  libraries/utilities so that programs can run reliably
- Similar in spirit to Virtual Machines or Emulation BUT has some
  technical distinctions which you can read about on your own time
- Docker allows for download/run of containers with programs in them
  via a GUI (blegh) or command line (yay!)

* Running Shell Slayer
Start the "Docker Desktop" application (via clicking things) then use
a command shell to download / run the shellslayer image via:

#+LATEX:\footnotesize
** Windows: ~cmd.exe~
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> docker run -it --rm kauffman77/shellslayer
#+END_SRC

** MacOS: ~Terminal.app~
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> docker run -it --rm --platform=linux/amd64 kauffman77/shellslayer
#+END_SRC

** Linux: Terminal Emulator of Choice
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> sudo docker run -it --rm kauffman77/shellslayer
#+END_SRC
~sudo~ may not be necessary depending on your system config

** Updating your Image
If you've previously done Shell Slayer, update your Docker image via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> docker pull kauffman77/shellslayer
#+END_SRC

* Structure of the Exercise
# #+LATEX:\footnotesize
- daemon (noun) ::
  1. Archaic spelling of demon
  2. In multitasking computer operating systems, a program that runs
     as a background process rather than being under the direct
     control of an interactive user.

#+LATEX:\normalsize
/You sense a foul presence in the process tree.../
- A "Daemon" process is present in the system and must be killed.
- To do so, you must switch to be the Root user (administrator)
- Becoming root requires a password
- Each level (~level_00_less~, ~level_02_editing~, ...) teaches about
  a Unix tool/technique and when completed properly will reveal part
  of the root password (one of the Daemon's names)
- Complete all levels, get the whole password, and slay the
  Daemon
