- Update level_10_sh_loops so that only the files ending exactly in
  .txt are used, NOT .dat.txt
- Add a mechanism to log ALL daemon names and verify them to ensure
  the root password is known when its ready; could have an altar.txt
  in the home directory and each name is placed in sequence in it with
  the LOG.txt indicating correct names; when all correct names are on
  the altar, level_99 is opened, perhaps via permission change by the
  same monitor that checks names
- Debugging facility needed so that quick checks can be done by
  enabling some debugging mode; check on Docker facilities for
  honoring environment variables or passing arguments
- Merge some common python functions into a module that can be
  imported; banner printing etc.
- Port some bash monitors and possibly main.sh to python
